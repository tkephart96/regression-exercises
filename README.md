Practice regression machine learning using the Zillow dataset on 2017 properties

I acquired the data from the Codeup MySQL DB

Grabbed 7 columns filtered by 'Single Family Residential': bedroomcnt, bathroomcnt, calculatedfinishedsquarefeet, taxvaluedollarcnt, yearbuilt, taxamount, and fips

Size was more 2.1 million rows, nulls accounted for less than 1% so I dropped those
