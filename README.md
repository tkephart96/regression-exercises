# Regression Exercises

Practice regression machine learning using the Zillow dataset on 2017 properties of three CA counties

I acquired the data from the Codeup MySQL DB

Grabbed 7 columns filtered by 'Single Family Residential': bedroomcnt, bathroomcnt, calculatedfinishedsquarefeet, taxvaluedollarcnt, yearbuilt, taxamount, and fips

Size was more 2.1 million rows, nulls accounted for less than 1% so I dropped those for now

Renamed columns

Mapped FIPS to county names

Handled outliers by filtering area to less than 25,000 and tax_value to less than its 95th quantile

Data after this is now about 2.03 mil rows

| bedroomcnt                   | beds      | Numeric | 0-25                | Number of bedrooms in home                               |

| calculatedfinishedsquarefeet | area      | SqFt    | 1~1mil              | Calculated total finished living area                    |
| taxvaluedollarcnt            | tax_value | USD     | 1~98mil             | The total tax assessed value of the parcel/home          |
| taxamount                    | prop_tax  | USD     | 1.85~1.3mil         | The total property tax assessed for that assessment year |
| fips                         | county    | County  | LA, Orange, Ventura | Federal Information Processing Standard (these 3 in CA)  |

FIPS County Codes:

* 06037 = LA County, CA
* 06059 = Orange County, CA
* 06111 = Ventura County, CA

Might turn FIPS to string for encoding later since it is not continuous, it is more of a category
